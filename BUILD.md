# CDAP ODBC Driver build instructions


## Prerequisites

 * MS Visual Studio 2015 Update 1
 * WiX Toolset v3.10 or higher

## Solution description

Solution contains 5 projects:
 * **CdapOdbc** - core and startup project, implements ODBC interface; should be used for debugging;
    * Note: this project contains VERSION resource that populates .dll file and product installer with version number  
 * **CdapOdbc.Core** - driver's functionality
 * **CdapOdbc.setup** - WiX installer;
 * **CdapOdbc.Tests** - functional tests;
 * **CdapOdbc.UnitTests** - unit tests;

Additional project **CdapOdbc.TestsManual** is not included into the solution and does not participate in building process. It is  container for test data files, CDAP CLI scripts and Excel sheet for manually testing Driver with Excel and Tableau. 

Build output path for .DLL file:
```
<path-to-solution>\<architecture>\<configuration>
```
Build output path for .MSI installer:
```
<path-to-solution>\CdapOdbc.setup\bin\<architecture>\<configuration>\en-us
```
Localisation is used to redefine standard WiX messages by adding custom text style.

## Build instructions
There are two ways you can build on Windows, from the command line or from Visual Studio.

### Build using Visual Studio 
The easiest way to build is by using the Visual Studio solution file. Open CdapOdbc140.sln file 
located in the root of repository and select **Build**-->**Build Solution** from the toolbar.

### Build using the command line
Alternatively, solution can be built from the command line:
* Go to Start menu and open one of Visual Studio 2015 Command Prompts depending on target platform.
* From Command Prompt navigate to project root folder.
* Run the following command:
```
> MSBuild
```

## Running tests 
To run tests execute the following:
```
>VSTest.Console.exe Debug/CdapOdbc.Tests.dll
```
or for x64:
```
>VSTest.Console.exe x64/Debug/CdapOdbc.Tests.dll /platform:x64
```
